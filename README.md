# SC1015 DSAI Group 3 Project 
 
**Our Motivation**
- Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. While the working mechanism of cryptocurrency differs from traditional currencies, its stock prices are still determined by the combination of supply, demand, competition, regulations, etc.
- As prices of cryptocurrencies **fluctuate strongly with time**, it is interesting to know whether ML models can identify some hidden patterns in the prices time series and use them to **predict future prices with decent accuracy**.

**Project Goal**
- This project aims to evaluate and compare different ML models on their performence of predicting future Bitcoin prices by fitting them to the past Bitcoin prices time series.

**Dataset Used**
We used the Bitcoin time series dataset from [Yahoo Finance Crypto](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD) to obtain Bitcoin prices from 2014 to 2023, cleaned and processed it for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
- [Dataset Folder](./data/Bitcoin/)

**Note:** Some datasets of other cryptocurrencies are scraped but are not included in the final project 

**Jupyter Notebooks**
- [Data Collection](./src/1.EDA.ipynb)
- [Data Cleaning and Preprocessing](./src/1.EDA.ipynb)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization](./src/1.EDA.ipynb)
- [ARIMA Model - Machine Learning](./src/2.ARIMA.ipynb)
- [LSTM and GRU Models - Machine Learning](./src/3.LSTM%26GRU.ipynb)

**Note:** Some Jupyter Notebooks are used but are not included in the final project (e.g. XGBoost Model)

**Slide Deck**
